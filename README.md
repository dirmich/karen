# Project Karen &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/lnxusr1/karen)](https://github.com/lnxusr1/karen/blob/master/LICENSE.md) [![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/yt2mp3.svg)](https://github.com/lnxusr1/karen/)
This project is dedicated to building a "Synthetic Human" which is called Karen (for now) for which we have assigned the female gender pronoun of "She". She has visual face recognition ([opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)), speech transcription ([mozilla/deepspeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech)), and speech synthesis ([festival](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/)).  Karen is written in Python and is targeted primarily at the single board computer (SBC) platforms like the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

## Goals
I'm not sure where we will end up but the goals for this project are pretty simple:

1. Must be able to do every day tasks (tell time, weather, and be context aware)
2. Must provide evidence of "thought" (I'm still working on what exactly this means)
3. Must be fun (because the moment it becomes "work" I'm sure we'll all lose interest)

**NOTICE** - Karen is under development against Python 3.7.  She is not compatible with Python 2 so be sure to use "python3" or "python3.7" (and install the related binaries if needed).
